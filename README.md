This repository contains Glen Raven emails.

*In addition to pushing your code, you should also be saving your work to the Data server!*

When saving to the project folder on Data, please use this structure:

```
{project}
  - html
    - build
      - {build files} (no node_modules or dist)
    - send to client
      - html.zip (contains all files in dist. if images are hosted on AWS, no need to include images here)
```
