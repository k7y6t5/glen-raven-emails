Healing gardens have become a cornerstone of this approach to enhancing mental, physical and social well-being.

The continuing education course Healing Gardens explores the role of fabric for shade and seating, the rise of healing gardens in healthcare settings and the growing body of scientific research on the benefits of nature.
