WHERE BEAUTY AND DURABILITY COME TOGETHER.

Featuring soft textures and gorgeous patterns, the Sunbrella Contract Showroom has the fabrics you need to design warm, welcoming spaces that are simple to maintain and clean, even with bleach.

When you specify solution-dyed Sunbrella Contract, you can be sure that our liquid- and stain-repellent treatments will offer the protection without any additional finishes or processing. Plus, more than 50 selections have been independently certified to meet NSF/ANSI 336 Silver Level and will be promoted by the third-party Facts certification program. They are also UL-certified to meet GREENGUARD Gold standards.

Find Sunbrella Contract fabrics through Brentano, Carnegie, C.F. Stinson, Designtex, HBF Textiles, Kravet Contract, Maharam, Mayer Fabrics, Pallas Textiles, Robert Allen Contract, Sina Pearson Textiles and Weitzner.
