DESIGN + PERFORMANCE ™

Sunbrella® Contract fabrics are engineered to bring unparalleled style to commercial environments while meeting the toughest standards in spaces with strict performance requirements. In the Sunbrella Contract Showroom (http://snb.la/1Ca), you’ll find the wide range of fabrics you need to create soothing, welcoming spaces that are simple to clean and maintain, even with bleach.

When you specify Sunbrella Contract fabrics, you get a fiber that is solution-dyed, repels liquids and stains, and needs no additional finishes or processing. Most fabric selections are independently certified to meet NSF/ANSI 336 Silver Level and UL-certified to meet GREENGUARD Gold Standards, and will be promoted by the third-party Facts Certification program. And with a 5-year limited warranty against abrasion and fading, every Sunbrella Contract fabric delivers proven performance you can trust.
